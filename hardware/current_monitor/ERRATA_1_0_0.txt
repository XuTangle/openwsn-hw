Cannot use DAC module w/ comparator.
    Fix:
       * Swap RA0 and RA3 so that C1INB is used instead of C1INA
    Workaround:
       * Use ADC to measure voltage OR simply digital input threshold

Stupid pin numbering on ZXCT10009!
    Fix:
       * Fix stupid pin numbering
    Workaround:
       * Resolder SOT-23 in funky way

Quiescent current of NX1117C is 5mA, minimum current is 0.8mA!
    Fix:
	* Replace with lower power regulator
    Workaround:
	* Try to do differential power analysis?
	* We can test low-current circuit by not populating daughter card

TX pin does not survive if daughter card is separated!
    Fix:
        Route it correctly
    Workaround:
        solder TX pin to pin on PIC or keep other board connected
